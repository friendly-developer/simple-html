  <h1>Important Concepts</h1>

  <b>How the Web Works</b>
  <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
   with each other. When a person goes to a web
   page like <a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends
   a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
   server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
   it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
   interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
  
  </p>
  <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
   literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
   small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
   in a <em>program. We as a developer need to take care about all these minute errors which 
   are easy to figure for a human but a nightmare for a computer, like forgetting to end this emphasis tag</em>
  </p>

  <b>HTML</b>
  <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em><br> HTML documents form the majority of the
   content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes <strong>"what you see"</strong>
   and <em>markup</em> which describes <strong>"how it looks"</strong>.
  </p>

  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.<br>
   These tags are of different types and almost everything displayed in a HTML will be present in a tag.
   These tags may or may not have an end tag. The content inside these tags including the tags are considered elements
  </p>

  <b>Containers</b>
  <p>  
   As the name explains, containers are nothing but a placeholder for all our code for the browser. 
   <em>Div</em> and <em>Span</em> tags are called container tags.
   These tags do nothing but show the data and form the mark ups that are either placed
   in their attributes or their childern's 
  </p>
  <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  <p> HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
   elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
   them. Div is best example of Block while Span is the best example for Inline.
   Since span is an inline element, placing div in its children's elements is not such a good idea.
